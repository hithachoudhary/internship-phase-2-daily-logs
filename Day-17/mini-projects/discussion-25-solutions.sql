-- Scenario 1: Advanced Analytics Dashboard
    --Create an inline view to calculate the daily total sales.
    create view daily_sales as select date(orderDate) as order_date, sum(quantityOrdered * priceEach) as total_sales from orders join orderdetails using (orderNumber) group by order_date;
    --Create an updatable view to show the number of orders for each day. Also include a functionality to update the order status in the same view.
    create view daily_orders as select date(orderDate) as order_date,count(orderNumber) as num_of_orders,status from orders group by order_date,status;
    update daily_orders set status = 'shipped' where order_date='2005-05-10';
    --Create a view to identify the most purchased product of each day.
    create view daily_top_product as select date(orderDate) as order_date,productCode,sum(quantityOrdered) as total_quantity from orders join orderdetails using (orderNumber) group by order_date,productCode order by total_quantity desc;
    --Finally, combine these views to produce the required daily report.
    select distinct order_date, total_sales, no_of_orders, (select productCode from daily_top_products where daily_top_products.order_date=daily_total_sales.order_date limit 1) as top_product from daily_total_sales join daily_orders using(order_date) join daily_top_products using(order_date);

--Scenario 2: Sales Monitoring System
    --Create a view that shows the total number of customers handled by each sales rep.
    create view rep_customers as select salesRepEmployeeNumber,count(distinct customerNumber) as num_of_customers from customers group by salesRepEmployeeNumber;
    --Create a view that displays the total payments received by each sales rep.
    create view rep_payments as select salesRepEmployeeNumber,sum(amount) as total_payments from customers inner join payments using (customerNumber) group by salesRepEmployeeNumber;
    --Create another view that shows the total number of orders handled by each sales rep.
    create view rep_orders as select salesRepEmployeeNumber,count(distinct orderNumber) as num_of_orders from customers inner join orders using (customerNumber) group by salesRepEmployeeNumber;
    --Finally, create a combined view that uses the above views to display the performance of each sales rep.
    create view rep_performance as select rc.salesRepEmployeeNumber,rc.num_of_customers,rp.total_payments,ro.num_of_orders from rep_customers rc inner join rep_payments rp on rc.salesRepEmployeeNumber = rp.salesRepEmployeeNumber inner join rep_orders ro on rc.salesRepEmployeeNumber = ro.salesRepEmployeeNumber;

--Scenario 3: HR and Sales Data Analysis
    --Create a view in the hr database that shows the department and age of each employee, ensuring that the employee table has the column birth_date.

    --Create a view in the classicmodels database that shows the sales performance of each employee.
    create view emp_sales_performance as select salesRepEmployeeNumber,sum(amount) as total_sales from customers inner join payments using (customerNumber) group by salesRepEmployeeNumber;
